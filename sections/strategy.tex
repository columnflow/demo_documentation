\section{Analysis strategy}

In order to find Higgs boson candidates, we need to reconstruct the four leptons in the final state. To select the four lepton candidates in the first place, we will need to write a \CCSPStlye{Selector} (Section~\ref{sec:selector}).

%, which will filter out all physics objects that do not fulfill the selection criteria. In this selector, we will implement \underline{kinematic cuts}, \underline{vertex cuts} and \underline{Isolation \& ID} criteria. We will also implement \underline{trigger selections} such that only events interesting for the $ZZ$ analysis are selected.
