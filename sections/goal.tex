\section{Physics example: $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4l$}
\justifying
\paragraph{}
The goal of this exercise is to reconstruct the standard model (SM) Higgs boson mass, using a selection targeting the four-lepton final state. This is considered a \textit{golden} channel to measure the properties of the Higgs boson because:
\begin{itemize}
	\item it is a \textbf{\underline{ fully resolved final state}} -- the Higgs boson can be reconstructed from the reconstructed particles;
	\item we have an excellent \textbf{\underline{ mass resolution}} -- due to the high lepton-$p_T$ resolution, we have optimal shape reconstruction of $m_{4l}$;
	\item there is a \textbf{\underline{ large signal to background ratio}} -- it is easy to discriminate between the peak of the reconstructed four-lepton mass ($m_{4l}$) and the overall flat background shape.
\end{itemize}
